# How to make text responsive in Bootstrap?

You can make text responsive in Bootstrap by using `vw` units or **media queries**.

The text size can be set with a `vw` unit, which means the "viewport width".

Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.

Resize the browser window to see how the font size scales.

```html
<h1 style="font-size: 8vw;">I am responsive</h1>
```
